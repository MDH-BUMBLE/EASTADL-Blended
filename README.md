<b>Vehicular Architectural Blended Modeling in EAST-ADL</b> <br>
In BUMBLE project, we are motivated to broadly transfer blended modeling benefits in EAST-ADL architecture to enhance automotive embedded systems development. To achieve this, we present a blended modeling approach in EAST-ADL architecture. For demonstration purposes, we developed a prototype where Xtext grammar and corresponding textual editors for EAST-ADL timing and variability packages are implemented. <br>
Detailed installation instructions are available in <b> installation manual.</b><br>
The detailed working of components and steps to reproduce results / experimentation can be found in the <b> user manual. </b> <br>
